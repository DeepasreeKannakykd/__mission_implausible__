# Glow Down 🎯


## Basic Details

### Project Description
Style-Critic is a satirical fashion app that offers hilariously bad style tips to help users intentionally glow down. Built using V0.dev and deployed on Vercel, the app embraces fashion disasters, mismatched outfits, and chaotic advice — on purpose.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Everyone’s obsessed with glowing up, following trends, and looking their best — but what about those who want to glow down? There’s no app for people who want to dress worse, clash harder, and make fashion choices that scream “why?” We’re solving the nonexistent crisis of not having a guide to look intentionally terrible.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Enter Style-Critic — your personal anti-stylist. Instead of helping you look better, we proudly guide you toward fashion chaos: crocs with suits, glitter overload, and haircuts no one should replicate. With a tap, you’ll get terrible tips, cringe-worthy combos, and confidence to walk out looking like a glorious mess. You're welcome (or... sorry?).

# Screenshots 
<img src="Screenshot 2025-08-08 181404.png"> 
The landing page of Style-Critic, a humorous AI-powered fashion app that offers intentionally bad style advice. Users can upload their outfit to receive terrible tips with the “Ruin My Style” button or browse chaotic fashion fails through “Explore Chaos.” Key features include Instant Disasters, Anti-Glow Up, and The Stage — all designed to help users look gloriously unfashionable.

<img src="Screenshot 2025-08-08 190711.png">
The Upload Your Outfit section of the Style-Critic app, where users can submit their fashion photos for AI-powered roasts. Alongside the upload box is a guide titled Pro Tips for Maximum Destruction, offering humorous advice on how to get the harshest critique — from full-body shots and good lighting to flaunting accessories. A playful warning at the bottom reminds users that the AI is brutally honest, with side effects including laughter and existential fashion crises.

This screen displays the final results of the fashion roast. The app gives a Disaster Score (in this case, a proud 9.2/10), along with an over-the-top fashion emergency message and detailed chaos metrics like “Catastrophic” color coordination and “Confusing” overall vibe. Users can then share their chaos or “Add to the Stage” to showcase their disastrous masterpiece.

The image shows four colorful cards from a playful fashion app, each offering comically bad style features: Terrible Advice (red) for the worst fashion tips, Anti-Glow Up Tips (orange) to sabotage looks, The Stage (yellow) to showcase fashion fails, and Chaos Generator (purple) for AI-made disastrous outfit combos.

 <img src="Screenshot 2025-08-09 172918.png">
 The image shows “The Stage”, a gallery of legendary fashion disasters. Featured are The Time Traveler (9.8/10) with clashing decades, The Neon Nightmare (9.5/10) in blinding colors, and Formal Beach Vibes (9.2/10) pairing a tuxedo with flip-flops, each tagged, rated, and open for likes, comments, and sharing.
